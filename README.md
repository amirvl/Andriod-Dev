User Study Development: A Comparative Analysis: Traditional vs. Gamified Learning Models in Driving Learning Mobile Application

Creative Description:

	_Exploring Gamified Learning in a Mobile App_
	
	In this project, we designed and developed a mobile learning application aimed at teaching driving rules and procedures through two different models: a traditional learning approach and a gamified one. The app allows users to experience both models and compare their effectiveness based on their experience, performance, and energy consumption on various devices. Our teamâ€™s goal was to explore how gamification affects learning outcomes and user engagement. By analyzing completion times, accuracy rates, and user feedback, we sought to discover which model offers a more effective learning experience.
	
	In this project, I played a key role in managing the team, overseeing the design of the project, and coordinating tasks to optimize our workflow. I was also responsible for designing the user interface and finalizing the code while running critical test cases to ensure smooth operation. The findings of our study revealed that the gamified model significantly boosted user engagement and learning efficiency, suggesting that gamification could be a promising tool for educational apps in the future.

Technical Description:

	_Comparative Study of Traditional and Gamified Learning Models in a Mobile Application_
	
	This project involved the design and development of a full-stack mobile application to investigate the comparative effectiveness of traditional versus gamified learning models for teaching driving rules and procedures. The application was built to offer users alternatives in GUI elements and interaction methods, which were evaluated for usability, performance, and energy consumption on multiple devices.
	
	### Project Objectives and Approach:
	
	- **Within-Subjects Design**: Ten participants engaged with both traditional and gamified models, enabling systematic analysis of learning performance, engagement, and resource usage.
	- **Data Collection**: Quantitative metrics, including lesson completion times, test accuracy, and CPU usage, were collected alongside qualitative user feedback on their learning experience.
	- **Findings**: The study showed that the gamified model improved lesson completion times and test accuracy, especially in complex knowledge areas, without degrading app performance despite higher CPU usage peaks.
	
My Role:
	
	As the project manager, I was responsible for coordinating tasks, optimizing team efforts, and ensuring seamless communication. I led the project design and UI creation while finalizing code and running test cases to validate app functionality and performance.
